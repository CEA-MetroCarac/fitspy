Developers Notes
================

Fitspy is a new project (started in 2023).

Developers are warmly encouraged to collaborate and contribute to the ongoing improvement of Fitspy. Contributions are welcome in the form of bug reports, documentation, code , feature requests, and more...

... keeping in mind that Fitspy must maintain its primary goal: to remain as simple, generic and user-friendly as possible :)


Issues
------

The `issue tracker <https://github.com/CEA-MetroCarac/fitspy/issues>`_ can be used to report bugs or propose new features. When reporting a bug, the following is useful:

* give a minimal example demonstrating the bug,

* copy and paste the error traceback.

Pull Requests
-------------

If you want to contribute to improve the Fitspy source code, you can send us a `pull request <https://github.com/CEA-MetroCarac/fitspy/pulls>`_ against the main branch. Small bug fixes and corrections to the user guide are typically a good starting point. But don’t hesitate also for significant code contributions, such as support for a new file format - if needed, we’ll help you to get the code ready to common standards.


TODO List
---------

* investigate erratic timelaps when opening files with tkinter.filedialog
* update dynamically the 2D map figure during fitting
* make widgets size depending on the users screen size
* enable widget stretching
* **change Tkinter for pyQt or PySide** :) (task scheduled for mid-2024)
* create a fitspy icon for the taskbar
* create an 'About'
* add the progress bar inside the GUI
